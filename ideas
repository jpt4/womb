Functional set! - if the underlying memory model of
program's runtime is monotonic (i.e. via reversible hardware), set!
should translate to rebinding, not replacing, a name with a value,
essentially creating a new "top level" or "most recent" name-value
pair. First class environments, the hoon context, monadic I/O, etc.,
simulate this behavior in software, but would either be unncessary or
suffer less translation debt if implemented on exposed monotonic
memory.
