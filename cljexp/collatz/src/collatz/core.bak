;Revised algorithm to produce a canonical ordering of the Collatz Tree:
;Begin with Upper Bound set to 1.
;Inspect all leaves of the tree and calculate their successors.
;Select and add the smallest successor less than the Upper Bound.
;Repeat until no potential successor is less than or equal to the Upper Bound.
;Increment the Upper Bound by 1, and repeat.

;;Revised algorithm to produce a canonical ordering of the Collatz Tree:
;Given a tree of size k, and a desired tree of size s, calculate all valid 
;next largest extensions to the tree, select the smallest such extension, 
;and append it. Increment k (optionally annotating the selected extension
;with its index), and iterate until k=s.
