On the Descent of Rigor

"Rigor" is the independence of a reason from a reasoner. A rigorous
argument is mobile from its source, and preserves its force of
justification when separated from the conditions of its
construction. Defined as a process rather than a property, rigor is
identified with externalization, such that arguments which provide
high confidence in the conclusions they justify retain their
justificatory prowess despite their agent of articulation - in
extremum, an ideally rigorous argument would compel a conclusion
irrespective of circumstance, with no appeal to any other mechanism
than the argument itself. This ouroboric but yet meaningful argument
would thus be an example of autarkic reason [0].

elaboration.
